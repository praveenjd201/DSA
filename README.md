# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! Here, I've documented my journey of learning Java programming language by practicing various DSA questions. Mastering DSA is crucial for becoming a proficient programmer as it forms the backbone of problem-solving skills and efficient algorithmic thinking.

## DSA Practice

In this repository, you'll find a collection of DSA questions that I've practiced while learning Java. These questions cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and dynamic programming.
